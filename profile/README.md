We are a developer-centric community of open-source enthusiasts. Our mission is to identify the unique needs during development and find the most fitting solutions for them.

## Solution discovery

🔭 Our journey of discovery is thoroughly documented [here][Octospot]. The finest open-source solutions we've encountered are curated at [AwesomenOSS][]. And for those challenges, if we haven't found an existing solution, we create our own and share them with everyone.

## Automation

🤖 We have a distaste for repetition, especially in mundane tasks. That's why, in [this project][Octomation], we've compiled everything related to the automation of routine tasks and the templating of approaches and solutions.

## Product development

🎁 We also focus on developing human-centric products to enhance our users' quality of life. You can explore our product sandbox [here][Octopods]. Our experimental endeavors are housed in separate organizations: [LifeOS][], [Sparkle][], and [Tact][].
